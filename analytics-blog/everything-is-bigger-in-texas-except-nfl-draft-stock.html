        <hr/>

				<p>Year after year I prepare myself for the same college football
				narratives – Clemson and Alabama will compete for the <span class=GramE>title,</span>&nbsp;Stanford
				will break my heart and Texas football is back… until its week five and the
				team is 2-2.&nbsp;</p>

				<p> So when I started
				dabbling in data from 247 Sports and Pro Football Reference a few weeks ago to
				see which schools underperform in the NFL Draft, I wasn’t surprised to see that
				Texas stands out. But the extent of the underperformance is shocking.</p>

				<figure class="left" style="width:600px;overflow:scroll;padding:5px;border:4px solid #ffffcc;">

				<p >&nbsp;Between 2005 and 2020, the Longhorns collected 183
				high school recruits that ranked in 247 Sports top 224. In theory, if those
				athletes neither progressed nor regressed during their college careers and
				spent the next three to five years in a vacuum, those same 183 athletes would
				all be selected with one of the NFL Draft’s 224 picks. But, obviously,
				progression and regression are inevitable and for players that commit to Texas,
				the later seems practically predestined.</p>

				<p >Based the number of recruits ranked in 247 Sports top 224
				since 2005, Texas ranks second nationally behind Alabama’s 219. </p>

				<p >Ohio State (181), USC (181) and Georgia (178) are close
				behind. But when the coin is flipped and draft day arrives, the Longhorns are
				abysmal. Since 2005, only 58 players have been picked according to data from
				Pro Football Reference, which ranks 17th.</p>

				<p >Meanwhile, the other top recruiting schools have had success
				spinning five- and four-star recruits into draft picks. Alabama, again, tops
				the list with 109 draft selections. Ohio State ranks third (101), USC fourth
				(93) and Georgia sixth (86). These five schools have produced on average 5.6
				draft selections each year since 2005. But for the past 10 years, the Longhorns
				have consistently weighed that number down.</p>

				<p >Since 2010, Texas hasn’t produced more than five picks. Even
				USC, a team that has&nbsp;<a
				href="https://saturdayblitz.com/2019/01/27/college-football-usc-story-of-why-powerhouses-fail/" target="_blank">struggled</a>&nbsp;in
				recent years, has performed better on draft day in seven of the last 10
				seasons.</p>

				<p >The cycle won’t break this weekend either. Only three Texas
				players are likely draft picks (<a

				class=SpellE>Ehlinger</span></a>) on the fringes.</p>

				<p >I connected with Longhorns beat writer <a
				href="https://www.hookem.com/author/bdavis/" target="_blank">Brian Davis</a> to better
				understand this perpetual underperformance, which Davis credited in part to
				lack of development.</p>

				<p >“Out of however many players that put themselves through the
				draft process, I bet you only maybe a quarter percent of those in the last
				seven, eight years, really were ready for the draft,” Davis told me over the
				phone. “They needed more time because they just weren't good enough.”</p>

				<p >Some of the underdevelopment, Davis said, is self-inflicted.
				He pointed to 2018 as evidence – a year when all six Texas underclassman who
				declared for the draft either&nbsp;<a

				not listen to</a>&nbsp;or did not wait for a grade from the NFL Draft Advisory
				Board.</p>

				<p >The <a
				href="https://www.burntorangenation.com/2021/1/25/22245232/steve-sarkisian-assistants-texas-longhorns-pete-kwiatkowski-jeff-banks-jeff-choate" target="_blank">lack
				of coaching consistency</a> also cannot be ignored.</p>

				<p >“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Vahe" target="_blank">Patrick&nbsp;<span
				class=SpellE>Vahe</span></a>&nbsp;was an offensive lineman who came through the
				system and he had four offensive line coaches in four years,” Davis said. “How
				is anybody expected to develop when that happens?”</p>

				<p ><span class=SpellE>Vahe</span>&nbsp;was a four-star high
				school <a href="https://247sports.com/player/patrick-vahe-28082/" target="_blank">recruit in
				2015</a>, ranked 129th nationally. After going undrafted in 2019, <span
				class=SpellE>Vahe</span> signed with the Baltimore Ravens, but was released
				during final roster cuts.</p>

				<p >Davis also thinks some guys are getting passed up simply
				because they played at Texas. “Just a kind of above average team doesn’t really
				generate a lot of heat with NFL folks,” he said.</p>

				<p >This year, he thinks that could be the case for Sam <span
				class=SpellE>Ehlinger</span>, who is <a
				href="https://www.si.com/college/texas/football/where-does-sam-ehlinger-rank-among-texas-quarterbacks-since-2000" target="_blank">statistically</a>
				one of the best quarterbacks in Texas history, but finished his career with
				only a 27-16 record as a starter. <span class=SpellE>Ehlinger</span> is
				projected to go in the seventh round, if at all.</p>

				<p >So, what gives? If new head coach Steve Sarkisian can’t
				establish some consistency and turn around the program, will top recruits stop
				signing with Texas? Seems unlikely.</p>

				<p >Between 2005 and 2020, the Longhorns have relied on their
				favorable location (according to data from 247 Sports and cfbfastR, only Florida has
				produced more high school athletes ranked in the top 224 in that time frame),
				consistently signing in-state talent.</p>

				<p >From 2005 to 2020, 160 Texas high school players committed
				to the Longhorns – twice as many as second place Texas A&M (73). Win or
				lose, in-state talent keeps coming despite <a
				href="https://www.texasfootball.com/article/2021/02/10/unfiltered-anonymous-recruit-survey-which-in-state-school-is-the-most-overrated-and-why?ref=article_preview_img" target="_blank">young
				athletes</a> recognizing not all is well in Austin.</p>

				<p >“They recruit so well because it’s Texas. It’s the flagship
				school. It's the big brand, it's the logo, it's everything that these kids grow
				up being inundated with,” Davis said. “But the question of why don't they get
				developed? That's really what it is. And that is also at the heart of why the
				program hasn't been winning over the last, seven, eight, nine years.”</p>

				<p >Time will tell if Sarkisian can spin stars into draft picks.
				But the next three days will definitely be another underwhelming draft for
				Longhorns fans.</p>
