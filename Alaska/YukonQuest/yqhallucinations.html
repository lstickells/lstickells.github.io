						<h3>You saw what? Hallucinations are a staple of the Yukon Quest trail</h3>
						<p><b>By Laura Stickells | February 3, 2020 </b></p>
          <hr />

            <p>CIRCLE CITY, ALASKA – Mushers stumbled into the Circle City checkpoint dizzy from the previous 50 miles of Birch Creek trail, which is known for being winding, never-ending and cold.</p>

            <p>YQ300 musher Sean Underwood said he even experienced short, five- or six-second hallucinations, a common experience on the trail as mushers become sleep-deprived. People in the checkpoint gathered around to hear his story.</p>

            <p>“I was in and out of consciousness and it would usually happen right when I would wake up out of nowhere…</p>

            <p>“I was looking at the wheel dogs and with the white background with the trail and the river it looked like they were climbing into a keyhole of a white truck… They had gotten their front half of their body in the keyhole and they were trying to get their hind legs in there.” </p>

            <p>He had another vision in which the dogs looked like his girlfriend staring back at him, resting her head on her hand.</p>

            <p>Once he passed a tree and thought it was his mom, and sometimes he’d confuse the rim of his parka hood as a cliff inches from the sled.</p>

            <p>“It was honestly kind of entertaining,” he said.</p>

            <p>Underwood slept for 30 minutes in the mushers room before heading back down Birch Creek toward the finish in Central.</p>

            <h4><b>Quest Notebook: Local students gets involved</b></h4>

            <p>The children at the Circle City school made a poster for each Yukon Quest musher. The 15 posters were hung around the Fire Hall. Some were decorated with drawings as well.</p>

            <p>Chase Tingle’s poster had a large sled drawn next to his name with the words “dog sled” written next to it and an arrow pointing toward the picture to avoid confusion.</p>
