						<h2>Yukon Quest</h2>
					</header>
					<div class="box">
						<h4>The Yukon Quest, which alternates starting and finishing between Fairbanks and Whitehorse, Yukon each year, is one of two 1,000-mile sled dog races in Alaska. While its more famous counterpart, the Iditarod, is better known in the Lower-48, the Yukon Quest is considered by many in the mushing community to be the more difficult contest. With fewer checkpoints and a harsher climate, only the toughest teams make it to the finish. </h4>
						<blockquote class="twitter-tweet-right"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Watching these dogs get so excited for the start of the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/YQ2020?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#YQ2020</a> was one of the cutest things I have ever seen. <br><br>My fingers might be cold, but my heart is warm!! <a href="https://t.co/Df8ngmUE4F">pic.twitter.com/Df8ngmUE4F</a></p>&mdash; Laura Stickells (@LauraStickells) <a href="https://twitter.com/LauraStickells/status/1223728202922639360?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 1, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
						<h4>I covered the race's preparations and the first three days of the contest, but unfortunately the News-Miner wasn't able to send me past the Alaska border. The time I spent on the trail was unforgettable and also a true test of my journalistic abilities. The temperature, which at times reached -30 degrees, caused tape recorders to die instantly and pens to freeze. A plentiful supply of fresh batteries was helpful, but pencil and paper was the most reliable option. Camera batteries died in minutes, camera shutters would freeze shut and lenses could fog for hours. I learned a lot from the Quest's veteran photographers - keep your camera battery stashed in your pocket next to a hand warmer until right before you need it and always leave your camera outside until you're done for the day. Internet also wasn't available on the trail leaving the hunt for wifi so I could file my story and photos at the end of the day an adventure of its own. </h4>
						<h4>Although the harsh Alaska climate provided challenging technical details, the mushers, dogs and volunteers on the trail made writing never feel easier. I hope you enjoy reading their stories as much as I loved writing them. </h4>
