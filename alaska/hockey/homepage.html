										<h3>Nanooks fall in first playoff test</h3>
										<p> March 7, 2020 </p>

										<p>	Two Bowling Green power play goals in the third period lifted the Falcons to a 4-2 win over the University of Alaska Fairbanks on Friday at the Carlson Center.</p>
										<p>	The loss leaves the fourth seeded Nanooks trailing 0-1 in the best-of-three Western Collegiate Hockey Association Quarterfinals and one more loss will end their playoff run, all but eliminating them from further postseason play.</p>

										<p>March 6, 2020 </p>

										<p>Three weekends ago, Bowling Green and the University of Alaska Fairbanks left the Carlson Center with two ties and three points each.</p>
										<p>With Bowling Green ranked 24th and Alaska ranked 33rd in the national PairWise Rankings, an automatic bid as a conference champion will likely be either team’s only shot at a berth in the 16-team NCAA postseason tournament.</p>

										<h3>Nanooks clinch 11th straight Gov Cup, home ice</h3>
										<p> March 1, 2020 </p>
									</header>
										<p>The University of Alaska Fairbanks went into Saturday night’s game needing only one point to win its 11th straight Governor’s Cup — anything but an outright loss followed up with a tie-breaking shootout loss would have been enough to clinch the title — but the last contest of the 27th annual four-game series against the University of Alaska Anchorage still felt like a must-win.</p>

										<h3>Nanooks one point away from Gov Cup title</h3>
										<p> February 29, 2020 </p>
									</header>
										<p>The University of Alaska Fairbanks is one point away from hanging a new Governor’s Cup banner from the Carlson Center rafters after overcoming its third consecutive multi-goal deficit, with the help of a third period hat trick from Steven Jandric, to defeat the University of Alaska Anchorage 5-2 in the third game of the four-game series.</p>

										<h3>Nanooks fall to Falcons in shootout</h3>
										<p> February 16, 2020 </p>
									</header>
										<p>For the second night in a row, Bowling Green State coughed up an early lead to the University of Alaska Fairbanks and the teams couldn’t determine a winner after 60 minutes of regulation and five minutes of overtime.</p>
										<p>However, unlike Friday’s game, which was decided 45 seconds into 3-on-3 play with a goal from Alaska’s Kylar Hope, Saturday’s game was decided by Bowling Green’s Brandon Kruse in the fourth round of a shootout after a 3-3 tie.</p>

										<p>The University of Alaska Fairbanks hockey team fell 2-1 in double overtime to Lake Superior State on Saturday at the Carlson Center, for its first tie of the season.</p>
										<p>While they missed out on the extra point, reaching 3-on-3 play felt like a small victory for the Nanooks, as it helped them collect more than three points in a home series.</p>

									<p>	A brawl broke out between the players remaining on the ice as the final buzzer sounded at the Carlson Center on Saturday night, ending what was a high strung Western Collegiate Hockey Conference matchup between University of Alaska Fairbanks and Ferris State.</p>
									<p>	Alaska won the game 3-1 and UAF forward Max Newton said the “stick up for one and other” mentality was what made the difference.</p>
